# google-projects
This is a project folder for google scripts (.gs) for personal projects I did for school management. All code is free to use. 
I may or may not have created each project from scratch.
Some inspiration may have come from G Suite guides on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleApps)

Anyways..
Thank you for checking out my code!
